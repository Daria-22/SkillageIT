Keep file paths short and sensible.
Do not use special characters or spaces in your file names, these cause trouble because of differences in Mac/Windows systems.
Always pull before beginning work on your project, and before you push, in case someone has done any work since the last time you pulled â€“ you would not want work to get lost or to have to resolve many coding conflicts.
